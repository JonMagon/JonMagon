### Hi 👋 Dmitry is here

My nickname is pronounced /dʒɑn mɐˈɡon/.

💬 I speak 🇷🇺 Russian, 🇺🇸 English, and 🇩🇪 German. Well, my English sometimes up and down.

🎓 I'm [a Computer Science student](https://kubsau.ru/education/portfolio/students/20b48ee3-b072-4438-b9b0-fd468d075fb2/) at Kuban State Agrarian University, Russia.

❤️ I really like reverse engineering, Linux, and Admiral Bahroo's panda. 🐼

🔭 I'm currently not working and looking for a job. So if you have something to offer, let me know.
