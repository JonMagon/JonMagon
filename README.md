### Hi 👋 Dmitry is here

My nickname is pronounced /dʒɑn mɐˈɡon/.  
💬 I speak 🇷🇺 Russian, 🇺🇸 English and 🇩🇪 German. Well, my English sometimes up and down.

🎓 I'm an Informatics student at Kuban State Agrarian University. 

❤️ I really like reverse engineering, C++, Linux and Admiral Bahroo's panda. 🐼

🔭 I'm currently not working and looking for a job. So if you have something to offer, let me know.
